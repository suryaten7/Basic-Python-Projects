we will be working with the Titanic Data Set from Kaggle. This is a very famous data set.

We'll be trying to predict a classification- survival or deceased. Let's begin our understanding of implementing Logistic Regression in Python for classification.

We'll use a "semi-cleaned" version of the titanic data set, if you use the data set hosted directly on Kaggle, you may need to do some additional cleaning not shown in this lecture notebook.
